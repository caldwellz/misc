GitHub Upload Notes, 2018: Overmind, written in late 2012 / early 2013 and published on SF (https://sourceforge.net/projects/overmindgame/), is the only game engine attempt so far where I have reached an actual interesting visual technical demo, although of course later attempts / rewrites have been more structurally / algorithmically mature and interesting under the hood. See OriginalReadme.txt for library dependencies and my original notes.
