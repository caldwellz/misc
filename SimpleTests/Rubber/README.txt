GitHub Upload Notes, 2018: This is a simple network peer-to-peer (with master node) connection test program using the ENet library, written in Dec 2013. It was intended to enable any game engine project that I integrated the functionality into to broadcast (and possibly confirm if needed) to all connected peers, essentially bouncing messages around, hence the name. There is no actual messaging beyond connection though since I figured that would be project-specific.
