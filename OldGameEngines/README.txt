GitHub Upload Notes, 2018: These were several of my half-baked pre/post Overmind game engine attempts showing more forays into using CMake, Doxygen, POCO, 3D engines, and some other tools / techniques / libraries. See Overmind for my first actual interesting technical demo.
The TwilightCodex Messaging version does have an interesting in-memory Property database using an XML tree and a (you guessed it) component messaging system though, plus some pregenerated HTML documentation.
Also, any references to "Twilight Codex" actually have nothing to do with a certain popular book series, as you might think; I simply thought it was a cool project name and didn't realize then that it had already been snatched.
MAGES, on the other hand, is a slightly more recent (June-Dec 2016) unsuccessful attempt at cleverness.
