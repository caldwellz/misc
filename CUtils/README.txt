Miscellaneous small utilities written in C, back in my early programming days before I got into C++.

incbuild (June/July 2011): Increments a build version number in a header.

nreasm (June 2011): Tool to take ndisasm output and convert it so it can be assembled again. I don't recall how well the resulting assembly code actually worked, if at all, but I'll blame that part on ndisasm.

isprime & pispigot (July 2011): Basically my first forays into Win32 interface programming and mathematical algorithms.
