# misc
This "misc" repository serves as a portfolio of my (potentially unfinished / not working) small projects that don't really deserve their own repo, and other miscellaneous personal code. Most of it is C and C++ from 2011-2014, after which I took a two-year sabbatical from programming to do some volunteer service. I also eventually hope to include my even older QuickBasic / x86 assembly code if I ever find it. There are some recent small things here as well, but to find my portfolio of code written for university classes and projects, see my "zc101.github.io" (web development class) and "univ-code" (everything else) repositories.
For this repo I have also created new READMEs in most subfolders with more notes and details for each, and if I used Git on a project, copied the log to GIT-LOG. Also, even though most things here were written years ago and never actually otherwise published in most cases, I've left any original copyright tags intact (except for changing silly screen names to my real name), and just FYI most files were originally licensed under either the Mozilla Public License v2 or the GPL v3.
However, any Source Code Form in this "misc" repository that is entirely my own work and that also does not contain any form of license header (such as MPL or GPL boilerplate text), I hereby release into the Public Domain, with no guarantees or warranties of any kind, express or implied.
