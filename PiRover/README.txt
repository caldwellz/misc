This is a little Python app I wrote and refined from mid-2017 to April 2018 to control a little "rover" I had constructed from a Raspberry Pi and an old R/C car. Currently there is only Bluetooth connectivity and the platform backend support can be a little shaky, but it is fully functional as long as you have working pybluez and pygame libraries. By default it runs in device mode (i.e. the microcontroller side) unless you pass 'host' as a command-line flag.
