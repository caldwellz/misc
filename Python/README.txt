Misc Python scripts.

FileListByTime (Dec 2017): Get a path from the user and write a list (sorted by getmtime()) of files to file-list.txt.

FileListByWrite (Dec 2017): Get a path from the user and display a list of files according to the order returned by os.walk() (which at the time I assumed would be in filesystem-table order rather than sorted).

pwgen (June 2018): Basic secure password generator. Has support for copying the password to the Win32 clipboard, but I currently have that commented out for portability.

StockTracker (Sept 2018): Simple stock price-target alerts using the WorldTradingData.com API and Win32 message boxes. My personal API key and watchlist have been removed.
